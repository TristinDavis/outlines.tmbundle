  <b>Outline Tools</b><br>
  (c) 2005 Eric Hsu, textmate@betterfilecabinet.com<br>
  <br>
  This bundle processes simple text outlines (where the level is
  determined by the number of leading tabs).<br>
  <br>
  For instance,<br>
  <pre>
Coffee
Tea
        Black tea
        Green tea
                China
                Africa
Milk
</pre>is a canonical one from
http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_nestedlists2<br>

  <br>
  Anyway, this set of commands transforms tab-outlines into the
  following forms:

  <ol type="1">
    <li>(inline)

      <ol type="a">
        <li>Markdown</li>

        <li>Kwiki (and other wikis like PMWiki, the Textmate
        Wiki)</li>

        <li>HTML (both unordered and ordered)(yes, it validates as
        HTML 4.01 Transitional)</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>(in other applications)

      <ol type="a">
        <li>OmniOutliner (selection shows up in OO as an imported
        OPML)</li>
		
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>(in another document)

      <ol type="a">
        <li>OPML (since we need the non-obvious header to make it
        real OPML)</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>


Yes, this list was made with "Tab to HTML OL". If you don't
  like the types of OL that I use down the hierarchy, edit the
  script "t2ol.pl" and change the @type array.<br><br>

The original reason this bundle was made was for the OmniOutliner command, since OO inexplicably lacks a 'paste tab outline as Outline' command.
